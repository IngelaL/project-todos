# Project Todos

This project is a todo app built in React using Redux.

## The problem

I started the project by planning which components to use and what the reducers should contain. The planning is a key factor to make a well structured code that you can easily follow. I have learned how to structure a redux store by setting up reducers and actions, and how to interact with the store by using selectors or by dispatching actions in the components. 

Next step would be to place the styled components in separate files. I have kept them in the components since I found it useful, but in some components there is too much styling.
